Description: This package performs pseudotemporal ordering, inference of expression dynamics, and visualization of cyclical biological processes from single-cell RNAseq data. Using a combination of low-dimensional embedding, principal curves, and modeling of gene expression over pseudotime, we can reconstruct cyclical biological processes such as the cell cycle or germinal center B cell reactions.
